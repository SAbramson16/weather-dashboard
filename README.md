# weather-dashboard

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard.

## Installation

 The CSS, Javascript and images are located in the assets folder. This can be deployed on a web server, such as Github Pages.

## Usage

The user will input the city of the weather they are looking for. If there are multiple cities with that name, a drop down menu will appear where the user can select the specific city they are looking for. Once the city is selected, the weather information for the day will be shown, as well as a 5 day forecast. The cities that the user has previously searched for will be saved on the dashboard, and the user will be able to clear the list if they wish. 

The website can be launched by using GitHub pages, and follwing this URL: https://sabramson16.github.io/weather-dashboard/
